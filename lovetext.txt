I love you and it is getting worse
Remember- we are madly in love so kiss me anytime you feel like it
In a 1000 thousand life times I would find you and I would choose you
Each day I love you more, today more than yesterday and less than tomorrow
My days are brighter the sky a deeper blue and nights are sweeter when I am with you
I love the magnificence that comes out of your eyes. You are lit from within
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me
No measure of time being with you will ever be long enough
I love you because - the entire universe conspired to help me find you
You are my wife
I am in love with you
I love you more everyday
Kiss me immediately
You are my angel
I wish I could turn back the clock. I would find you sooner, make triplets and love you longer
When I tell you I love you I don’t say it out of habit. I say it to remind you that you are the best thing that ever happened to me
In case you ever foolishly forget - I am never not thinking of you
If love be madness may I never find sanity again
I feel like a silly school boy
My days with you are precious
Playing with your python is healthy for you
Make love to me right NOW
Stay with me
The plan is the plan
Keep me for 47 years
Just when you think it cant get any worse - it might. Just when you think it cant get any better - it does
I prefer when I can roll over at 2 AM to find your lips instead of a text
All of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges all your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me. I’ll give my all to you
your body is like a back road I am drivin with my eyes closed and I know every curve like the back of my hand
Keep me
Stay with me
I saw that you were perfect and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more
You know you are in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other
I need you like a heart needs a beat
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you… I could walk through my garden forever
Take my hand take my whole life too. For I can’t help falling in love with you
If you live to be a hundred I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you
You are the closest to heaven that I’ll ever be
To the world you may be one person but to me you are the world
I have tried so many times to think of a new way to say it and it’s still I love you
Sometimes all I need is a touch from you and all my stress will melt away
If you remember me then I don’t care if everyone else forgets
Come near now and kiss me
When I see your face there’s not a thing that I would change cause you’re amazing – just the way you are
And in your smile I see something more beautiful than the stars
Love is being stupid together
I think I would miss you even if we never met
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Being deeply loved by you gives me strength while loving you deeply gives me courage
I never want to stop making memories with you
There is a madness in loving you. A lack of reason that makes it feel so flawless
When I watch you from across the room I notice all the things I love about youWith great love comes great responsibilityI promise to love you and only you until my last breathI adore you and I want EVERYTHING for you and for usYou and I can have some time together to do as we chooseTake the 47 years they are yoursI Love you We are in love We live together and the Plan is the PlanI will keep you as my favourite person laugh with you go on adventures with you support you through lifes tough moments be proud of you grow old with you and find new reasons to tell you how much I love you every dayI Jeffrey Irving Jones take you Kristina Leila Reynolds to be my lawful wedded wifeI promise to love you to cherish you and to be faithful to you whatever life may bring us
I want you to know everyday how much I love you
I like me better when Im with you
Thinking of you keeps me awake
Dreaming of you wakes me up hoping you are there next to me
You make me feel like life is worth it
If I loved you less I might be able to talk about it more
We love with a love that is more than love
I loved you from the first day
I think of you while I am falling asleep and then as soon as I wake up
You are magnificent
Trust or love I asked you said trust and then we got love too
Where there is love there is life. You are life
I didn’t know love would hurt this much
Never doubt that I love you
I don’t want anything else in the world
Love is a fire but you can never tell if its going to warm your heart or burn down your house
You are my fiery princess I love you
True love is rare and it is the thing that gives my life meaning. It is you
You are so beautiful
Remember I love you and know that no one can take it ever
I just read that I am supposed to find what I love and let it kill me.  Hmmm… I wonder
Our love is eternal
Yes its crazy. Love is either crazy or it's nothing at all
At the end of true love is death and only the love that ends in death is love
Love is often the longing for repetition
Love is the part of all of us that lives outside of time. Perhaps we become aware of our age only at exceptional moments and most of the time we are ageless
Love helps you make up your mind about something without knowing why and your decision persists by the power of the nature of inertia in love
Love should make sure you never allow the future to collapse under the burden of memory
Without realising it we compose life according to the laws of beauty and love especially in times of greatest distress
When the heart speaks the mind ought to always find it indecent to object
